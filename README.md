## Data-mining using Alzheimerâ€™s disease gene data. 
1. Grouped genes to get the underlying system in the brain of AD patients using k-means clustering. 
Two similarity measures were used. 
2. Apply PCA to the features of the dataset of AD and control combined; Plot the AD cases (labeled in red) and normal
controls (labeled in green) in a 3D figure where the 3 coordinates correspond to the first 3 largest eighenvectors. 
3. Apply SVD to the dataset of AD and control combined; Examine the relationship between the eigenvectors of PCA and 
the corresponding singular vectors.
